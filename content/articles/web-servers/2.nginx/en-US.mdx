# Complete Nginx Guide - High Performance Web Server

Nginx is one of the most popular web servers in the world, known for its high performance, stability, and low resource consumption. In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn everything you need to know about Nginx.

## What is Nginx?

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a powerful web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. Created by Igor Sysoev in 2004, it has become the go-to choice for high-traffic websites.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Handles thousands of concurrent connections efficiently
- **Low Memory Usage**: Optimized architecture with minimal resource consumption
- **Reverse Proxy**: Acts as an intermediary for backend servers
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple servers
- **Static Content**: Serves static files extremely fast
- **SSL/TLS Support**: Built-in HTTPS support with modern protocols

## Installation

Installing Nginx is straightforward on most Linux distributions:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install nginx

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

## Basic Configuration

The main configuration file is typically located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. Here's a simple configuration example:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    
    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Nginx is an essential tool for modern web infrastructure. Its performance and versatility make it ideal for any scale of deployment.
