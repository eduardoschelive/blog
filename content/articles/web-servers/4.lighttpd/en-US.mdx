# Lighttpd - Lightweight and Lightning Fast

Lighttpd (pronounced "lighty") is a web server designed for speed and efficiency. With a small memory footprint and optimized for high-performance environments, it's an excellent choice for resource-constrained scenarios.

## What is Lighttpd?

Lighttpd is an open-source web server optimized for speed-critical environments while remaining standards-compliant, secure, and flexible. It was created by Jan Kneschke in 2003 and has been used by high-traffic websites like YouTube and Wikipedia.

## Key Features

- **Low Memory Footprint**: Uses significantly less memory than Apache or Nginx
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Handles many concurrent connections efficiently
- **FastCGI Support**: Excellent support for dynamic content
- **URL Rewriting**: Powerful rewrite engine similar to mod_rewrite
- **Load Balancing**: Built-in load balancing capabilities
- **Small Codebase**: Easy to audit and secure

## Installation

Getting started with Lighttpd is straightforward:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lighttpd

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install lighttpd

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start lighttpd
sudo systemctl enable lighttpd
```

## Basic Configuration

The main configuration file is located at `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf`:

```lighttpd
server.document-root = "/var/www/html"
server.port = 80

mimetype.assign = (
    ".html" => "text/html",
    ".txt" => "text/plain",
    ".jpg" => "image/jpeg",
    ".png" => "image/png"
)
```

## Use Cases

Lighttpd excels in specific scenarios:

- Embedded systems with limited resources
- Serving static content at high speed
- FastCGI application servers
- Development environments
- IoT devices

## Performance Optimization

Lighttpd is already fast, but you can optimize it further:

```lighttpd
server.max-connections = 1024
server.max-worker = 4
server.max-fds = 2048

# Enable compression
compress.filetype = ("text/html", "text/css", "text/javascript")
```

## Conclusion

If you need a lightweight, fast web server with low resource consumption, Lighttpd is an excellent choice. It's particularly well-suited for embedded systems and high-performance static content serving.
