# Envoy Proxy - Modern Service Mesh Proxy

Envoy is a modern, high-performance edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Originally built at Lyft, it's now the foundation for service mesh solutions like Istio and AWS App Mesh.

## What is Envoy?

Envoy is an open-source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. It provides advanced load balancing, observability, security, and network automation features. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated Envoy as a top-level project.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Load Balancing**: Support for multiple algorithms and automatic retries
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service discovery and health checking
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics, logging, and distributed tracing
- **gRPC Support**: First-class support for HTTP/2 and gRPC
- **Filter Architecture**: Extensible with custom filters
- **Hot Restart**: Update configuration without dropping connections
- **TLS/mTLS**: Mutual TLS authentication between services

## Architecture

Envoy uses a modular architecture with filters:

```
Listener → Filter Chain → Cluster → Endpoints
```

Each component is responsible for a specific part of request processing.

## Basic Configuration

Envoy uses YAML for configuration:

```yaml
static_resources:
  listeners:
  - name: listener_0
    address:
      socket_address:
        address: 0.0.0.0
        port_value: 10000
    filter_chains:
    - filters:
      - name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager
        typed_config:
          "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager
          stat_prefix: ingress_http
          route_config:
            name: local_route
            virtual_hosts:
            - name: backend
              domains: ["*"]
              routes:
              - match:
                  prefix: "/"
                route:
                  cluster: service_backend
          http_filters:
          - name: envoy.filters.http.router
  
  clusters:
  - name: service_backend
    type: STRICT_DNS
    lb_policy: ROUND_ROBIN
    load_assignment:
      cluster_name: service_backend
      endpoints:
      - lb_endpoints:
        - endpoint:
            address:
              socket_address:
                address: backend.example.com
                port_value: 80
```

## Running with Docker

Quick start with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name envoy \
  -p 10000:10000 \
  -v $(pwd)/envoy.yaml:/etc/envoy/envoy.yaml \
  envoyproxy/envoy:v1.27-latest
```

## Service Mesh Integration

Envoy is the data plane for popular service meshes:

- **Istio**: Uses Envoy as sidecar proxy
- **AWS App Mesh**: Built on Envoy
- **Consul Connect**: Optional Envoy integration
- **Kuma**: Envoy-based service mesh

## Observability

Envoy provides comprehensive observability:

```yaml
admin:
  address:
    socket_address:
      address: 0.0.0.0
      port_value: 9901

stats_sinks:
- name: envoy.stat_sinks.statsd
  typed_config:
    "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.metrics.v3.StatsdSink
    address:
      socket_address:
        address: statsd.example.com
        port_value: 8125
```

## Advanced Traffic Management

Envoy supports sophisticated routing:

- Circuit breaking
- Rate limiting
- Fault injection
- Traffic shadowing
- Header manipulation
- Weighted routing

## Conclusion

Envoy has become the standard proxy for modern microservices architectures. Its rich feature set and strong observability make it ideal for complex distributed systems.
