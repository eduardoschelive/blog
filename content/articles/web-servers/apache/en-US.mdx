# Apache HTTP Server - The Traditional Powerhouse

Apache HTTP Server has been the backbone of the web for decades. Despite newer alternatives, it remains incredibly popular thanks to its flexibility, extensive documentation, and powerful module system.

## What is Apache?

Apache HTTP Server, commonly referred to as Apache, is a free and open-source web server developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. First released in 1995, it has powered millions of websites worldwide.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Extend functionality with hundreds of modules
- **Virtual Hosts**: Host multiple websites on a single server
- **.htaccess Files**: Per-directory configuration without restarting
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Unix, Linux, Windows, and more
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Decades of documentation and community support
- **Dynamic Content**: Built-in support for PHP, Python, Perl, and more

## Installation

Installing Apache is simple across different platforms:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install httpd

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

## Basic Configuration

Apache's main configuration is typically in `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` or `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    
    <Directory /var/www/html>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

## Popular Modules

Apache's strength lies in its modular system:

- **mod_rewrite**: URL rewriting and redirection
- **mod_ssl**: HTTPS support
- **mod_proxy**: Reverse proxy functionality
- **mod_security**: Web application firewall
- **mod_cache**: Caching for improved performance

## Conclusion

Apache remains a solid choice for web hosting. Its flexibility and extensive feature set make it suitable for virtually any web project.
