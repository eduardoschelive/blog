# HAProxy - The Reliable High Availability Load Balancer

HAProxy (High Availability Proxy) is a free, fast, and reliable solution offering load balancing and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It's the de facto standard for software load balancing.

## What is HAProxy?

HAProxy is an open-source software that provides a high availability load balancer and proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based applications. Created by Willy Tarreau in 2000, it powers many of the world's most visited websites including GitHub, Reddit, and Stack Overflow.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Handles millions of requests per second
- **Layer 4 & Layer 7**: TCP and HTTP load balancing
- **Health Checks**: Active and passive health monitoring
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Offload SSL processing from backends
- **Stick Tables**: Session persistence and rate limiting
- **ACLs**: Powerful access control lists for routing decisions
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring and statistics

## Installation

Installing HAProxy on Linux:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install haproxy

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install haproxy

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start haproxy
sudo systemctl enable haproxy
```

## Basic Configuration

HAProxy configuration is in `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`:

```haproxy
global
    maxconn 4096
    log /dev/log local0

defaults
    mode http
    timeout connect 5000ms
    timeout client 50000ms
    timeout server 50000ms

frontend http_front
    bind *:80
    default_backend http_back

backend http_back
    balance roundrobin
    server server1 192.168.1.10:80 check
    server server2 192.168.1.11:80 check
    server server3 192.168.1.12:80 check
```

## Load Balancing Algorithms

HAProxy supports multiple balancing algorithms:

- **roundrobin**: Each server in turn
- **leastconn**: Server with least connections
- **source**: Based on client IP hash
- **uri**: Based on URI hash
- **random**: Random server selection

## Health Checks

Configure health checks to ensure traffic only goes to healthy servers:

```haproxy
backend http_back
    option httpchk GET /health
    http-check expect status 200
    server server1 192.168.1.10:80 check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 3
```

## SSL/TLS Configuration

Enable HTTPS with SSL termination:

```haproxy
frontend https_front
    bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/haproxy/certs/example.pem
    default_backend http_back
```

## Statistics Dashboard

Enable the statistics page:

```haproxy
listen stats
    bind *:8404
    stats enable
    stats uri /stats
    stats refresh 30s
    stats admin if TRUE
```

## Conclusion

HAProxy is the gold standard for load balancing. Its reliability, performance, and extensive feature set make it the top choice for high-availability deployments.
