# OpenLiteSpeed - High-Performance Open Source Web Server

OpenLiteSpeed is a high-performance, lightweight, open-source HTTP server developed by LiteSpeed Technologies. It's designed to handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal resource usage.

## What is OpenLiteSpeed?

OpenLiteSpeed is the open-source edition of LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise. It provides most of the features of the commercial version while remaining completely free. It's particularly popular for WordPress hosting due to its excellent caching capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Handles massive concurrent connections efficiently
- **Built-in Cache**: LSCache for incredible performance gains
- **Apache Compatible**: Reads .htaccess files and mod_rewrite rules
- **HTTP/3 Support**: QUIC and HTTP/3 protocol support
- **WebAdmin GUI**: Web-based administration interface
- **Anti-DDoS**: Built-in protection against attacks
- **Low Memory**: Minimal memory footprint

## Installation

Installing OpenLiteSpeed:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
wget -O - https://repo.litespeed.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openlitespeed

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start lsws
sudo systemctl enable lsws

# Set admin password
sudo /usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/admpass.sh
```

Access WebAdmin at: `https://your-server:7080`

## Basic Configuration

OpenLiteSpeed can be configured via:

1. **WebAdmin GUI** (port 7080)
2. **Configuration files** in `/usr/local/lsws/conf/`

### Virtual Host Setup

Through WebAdmin:
- Navigate to Virtual Hosts → Add
- Set document root, domain, and other settings
- Apply changes and graceful restart

## WordPress Optimization

OpenLiteSpeed is excellent for WordPress:

```bash
# Install LSCache plugin
# In WordPress admin, install "LiteSpeed Cache" plugin

# Install PHP LSAPI
sudo apt install lsphp80 lsphp80-common lsphp80-mysql
```

Configure virtual host to use LSAPI:

```
External App → Add → Type: LiteSpeed SAPI App
Name: lsphp80
Address: uds://tmp/lshttpd/lsphp.sock
```

## Performance Tuning

Optimize OpenLiteSpeed for high traffic:

```
Server Configuration → Tuning:
- Max Connections: 10000
- Max Keep-Alive Requests: 1000
- Connection Timeout: 60
- Max Cached Small File Size: 4096

Enable HTTP/3:
Listeners → SSL → QUIC: Enabled
```

## LSCache Configuration

Enable and configure LSCache for maximum performance:

```
Virtual Hosts → [Your VHost] → Rewrite:
Enable Rewrite: Yes
Rewrite Rules: WordPress default

Cache Configuration:
Enable Cache: Yes
Cache Storage Path: /usr/local/lsws/cachedata
```

## SSL/TLS Setup

Configure HTTPS with Let's Encrypt:

```bash
# Install certbot
sudo apt install certbot

# Get certificate
sudo certbot certonly --webroot \
  -w /usr/local/lsws/Example/html \
  -d example.com -d www.example.com

# Configure in WebAdmin:
# Listeners → SSL → SSL Private Key & Certificate
```

## Rewrite Rules

OpenLiteSpeed supports Apache-style rewrite rules:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]
```

## Performance Comparison

OpenLiteSpeed typically outperforms Apache:

- **Static Content**: 84x faster than Apache
- **PHP Processing**: 50% faster than Apache + mod_php
- **WordPress**: 3x faster with LSCache enabled
- **Concurrent Connections**: Handles 5x more connections

## Conclusion

OpenLiteSpeed is an excellent choice for high-performance web hosting, especially for WordPress sites. Its built-in caching, efficient architecture, and free licensing make it compelling for any web project.
