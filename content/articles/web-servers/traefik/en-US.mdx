# Traefik - Modern Cloud-Native Edge Router

Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. Built for dynamic environments, it automatically discovers services and configures itself dynamically.

## What is Traefik?

Traefik is an open-source edge router that seamlessly integrates with your existing infrastructure components and configures itself automatically and dynamically. Created with microservices and containers in mind, it's the perfect companion for Docker, Kubernetes, and other orchestration platforms.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Service Discovery**: Detects services automatically from Docker, Kubernetes, Consul, etc.
- **Let's Encrypt Integration**: Automatic HTTPS certificate generation and renewal
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple load balancing algorithms
- **WebSocket Support**: Full support for WebSocket connections
- **Middleware System**: Extensible with authentication, rate limiting, headers manipulation
- **API and Dashboard**: Real-time dashboard and REST API

## Installation with Docker

Getting started with Traefik using Docker:

```bash
# Create a docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.10
    command:
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

## Configuration Example

Traefik uses labels to configure routing:

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    image: myapp:latest
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.myapp.rule=Host(`myapp.example.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.myapp.entrypoints=web"
```

## Kubernetes Integration

Traefik works natively with Kubernetes using IngressRoute:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - web
  routes:
    - match: Host(`myapp.example.com`)
      kind: Rule
      services:
        - name: myapp
          port: 80
```

## Middleware Configuration

Traefik's middleware system adds powerful features:

```yaml
labels:
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.auth.basicauth.users=user:$$apr1$$..."
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.ratelimit.ratelimit.average=100"
  - "traefik.http.routers.myapp.middlewares=auth,ratelimit"
```

## Conclusion

Traefik is the ideal choice for modern cloud-native applications. Its automatic service discovery and dynamic configuration make it perfect for containerized and microservice architectures.
