## Expanding your solution toolkit

Data structures can help you understand a broader range of solutions for your programs. In software development, we're always dealing with data, and sometimes choosing the right way to organize it is an excellent start. While the good old array solves most problems, sometimes we need to take a step further.

## Why data structures matter

- **Performance**: The wrong structure turns instant operations into ones too slow for production
- **Scalability**: Code that works locally can fail with real data if the structure doesn't scale
- **Resource consumption**: Memory and CPU are finite - the structure defines how much you need of each
- **Maintainability**: Appropriate structures make code simpler and bugs easier to find

Mastering data structures is about developing intuition to choose the right tool based on your problem's real needs.

## What you'll learn

Each article in this category explores:

- How the structure organizes data in memory
- Available operations and their time/space complexities
- When to choose it over alternatives
- Real-world applications and common pitfalls
