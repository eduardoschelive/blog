Data structures are the backbone of efficient software. They define how information is organized in memory, what operations you can perform, and how fast those operations execute.

## From Chaos to Order

Without data structures, computers see only random bytes at memory addresses. Data structures transform this chaos into meaningful patterns, enabling you to:

- **Organize** related information logically
- **Access** data through well-defined patterns
- **Optimize** performance for specific operations
- **Abstract** complexity behind clean interfaces

## Linear vs Non-Linear

**Linear structures** arrange elements sequentially - each item has one predecessor and one successor. Think arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

**Non-linear structures** organize data hierarchically or as networks - one element connects to multiple others. Think trees, graphs, and hash tables.

## What Makes Them Different

Every data structure makes tradeoffs:

- **Memory layout** - Contiguous (arrays) vs scattered (linked lists)
- **Access patterns** - Random access vs sequential traversal
- **Operation costs** - Fast inserts but slow searches, or vice versa
- **Space overhead** - Minimal metadata vs pointer-heavy structures

The right choice depends on your specific use case. Need fast lookups? Hash tables. Maintaining order? Binary search trees. LIFO behavior? Stacks.

## Beyond the Basics

You'll encounter two key concepts:

**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)** define what operations exist and their behavior - the interface contract.

**Data Structures** are concrete implementations - how it's actually built in memory.

Example: A "Stack" is an ADT (LIFO behavior). You can implement it using arrays or linked lists - different data structures, same abstract behavior.

## What's Inside

Each article in this category explores:

- How the structure organizes data in memory
- Available operations and their time/space complexity
- When to choose it over alternatives
- Real-world applications and gotchas
