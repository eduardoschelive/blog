# Debug Category

This category is dedicated to testing and debugging all the components and features of the blog system. Here you'll find articles that showcase different MDX components, styles, and functionality.

## Purpose

The debug category serves as a testing ground for:

- MDX component rendering
- Syntax highlighting with Shiki
- Typography and text formatting
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility features
- Responsive design

Use the articles in this category to verify that all components are working correctly and to test new features before deploying to production.
